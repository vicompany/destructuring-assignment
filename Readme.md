# Destructuring assignment

The `destructuring assignment` syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

## Why should I use it?

It will make your life much easier.

## I don't get it, where is the demo?

All destructuring tips and tricks are documented using unit tests. Just check the [test/test.js](test/test.js) file.

Or clone the project and:

* Run `npm install`.
* Followed by `npm test`.
* Profit!
